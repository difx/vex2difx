X fails on RDV -- aweful.

What to do about modes that don't support all antennas? (c081a.skd)?


TODO in vex2difx

1. Capitalization of Antenna names and obs code
2. # sign
3. load params file
4. Pulsar support
5. Spacecraft support
6. Handle files (i.e., not Mark5 modules)
7. Handle multiple phase centers

Concerns outside vex2difx proper

1. Need ant velocities and pos'n epoch in vex file
2. Need to get module shelf location from track 
3. Calcode/Qualifier in vex
4. Get exper_nominal_{start,stop} in vex files
